            <p id="name">– GEORGE CONDO</p>
            <p id="body">George Condo (American, b.1957) is a Contemporary visual artist who creates paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints. His work has influenced a whole generation of artists. Condo attended the University of Massachusetts in Lowell, where he studied art history and music theory. He moved to Boston after two years of college and worked in a silkscreen shop, then joined a band called The Girls. In the band, Condo met Jean-Michel Basquiat, and this meeting prompted Condo to move to New York & pursue a career as an artist. Condo began drawing around age four or five (his mother has kept all of his early drawings to this day). It was also his mother's idea to put him into Saturday painting classes at the YWCA. He recalled that he never drew stick figures or child-like drawings, his first-ever artwork was of an abstracted crucifixion scene. </p>
